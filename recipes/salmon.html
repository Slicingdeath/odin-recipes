        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>There are plenty of delicious ways to marinate fish for grilling,
                 but we're partial to this sweet and savory salmon marinade: 
                 Salmon filets are seasoned with lemon pepper, garlic powder, and salt, 
                 then marinated in a delicious combination of the following ingredients: 
                 soy sauce, brown sugar, water, and vegetable oil. Make sure to let the 
                 filets marinate in the fridge for at least two hours to reach their full 
                 flavor potential.
            </p>
